- `completion_date`: Timestamp set when status changes to 'done'
- `recur_pattern`: String for recurring task pattern (optional)
- `next_occurrence`: Timestamp for next occurrence of recurring task (optional)

#### Note Entity
- `id`: Auto-incrementing primary key
- `text`: String content of the note
- `creation_date`: Timestamp automatically set
- `task_id`: Nullable foreign key linking to a task (optional)
- `parent_note_id`: Nullable foreign key for hierarchical note relationships (optional)

#### Note Link Entity
- `id`: Auto-incrementing primary key
- `note1_id`: Foreign key to note table
- `note2_id`: Foreign key to note table
- `created_date`: Timestamp automatically set
