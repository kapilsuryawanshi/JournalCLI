**Objective:**
Build a lightweight, command-line journaling and task management application named `jrnl` in Python. The tool should be simple to use, low cognitive load, and effective for students or employees during work hours.

---

### General Requirements

* Runs as a command-line program: `jrnl [command] [arguments...]`.
* Stores all data in a local SQLite database.
* Supports two entities: **tasks** and **notes**.

---

### Data Model

**Task**

* `id` (auto increment)
* `title` (string)
* `status` (todo | doing | waiting | done, default = todo)
* `creation_date` (auto set)
* `due_date` (default = creation date, can be overridden)
* `completion_date` (set when moved to `done`)

**Note**

* `id` (auto increment)
* `text` (string)
* `creation_date` (auto set)
* `task_id` (nullable, links to task if provided)

---

### Commands

1. **Add tasks**

   ```
   jrnl . <text>[,<text>...]
   ```

   * Creates one or more tasks.
   * Each `<text>` is a task title.
   * A task title may include an optional due date keyword or explicit date using `@`:

     * Keywords: `today`, `tomorrow`, `eow` (end of week), `eom` (end of month), `eoy` (end of year)
     * Example: `jrnl . "Submit report @tomorrow, Finish taxes @2025-10-15"`

2. **Add notes**

   ```
   jrnl - [<task id>[,<task id>...]] <text>
   ```

   * Creates a note.
   * If task IDs are provided, links the note to those tasks. Otherwise, note is standalone.

3. **View journal (default)**

   ```
   jrnl
   ```

   * Shows outline view grouped by **creation date (ascending)**.
   * Within each day:

     * Task format: `<id>. [ ] <title>`

       * `[x]` if done.
       * Show due date inline `(due: YYYY-MM-DD)`.
       * Overdue tasks = red font.
       * Due today = cyan.
       * Status colors:

         * `doing` → yellow text
         * `waiting` → gray background
         * `done` → green text
     * Notes indented under parent task: `<id>. <text>`.

4. **View grouped by due date**

   ```
   jrnl due
   ```

   * Groups tasks as: Overdue / Due Today / Upcoming / No Due Date.
   * Sorted by due date within groups.
   * Shows notes indented beneath their associated tasks.
   * Notes are displayed with yellow foreground for better visibility.
   * Tasks with "doing" status are displayed with yellow background and black text.
   * Tasks with "waiting" status are displayed with gray background.

5. **View only tasks**

   ```
   jrnl tasks
   ```

   * Shows all tasks not marked `done`.
   * Tasks with "waiting" status are displayed with gray background.

6. **View only notes**

   ```
   jrnl notes
   ```

   * Shows all notes.

7. **Change task status**

   ```
   jrnl undone <id>[,<id>...]
   jrnl doing <id>[,<id>...]
   jrnl waiting <id>[,<id>...]
   jrnl done <id>[,<id>...]
   ```

   * Updates task status.
   * `undone` resets a completed task back to `todo`.
   * Shortcuts:

     * `jrnl x <id>` = mark task as `done`.

8. **Adjust due date**

   ```
   jrnl due <id> <keyword|YYYY-MM-DD>
   ```

   * Changes due date for a task.
   * Supports same keywords as task creation (`today`, `tomorrow`, `eow`, `eom`, `eoy`).

9. **Help**

   ```
   jrnl help
   ```

   * Prints list of all commands with usage examples.

---

### Example Commands

```
jrnl
jrnl . Do homework,Read article @tomorrow
jrnl - 2 Remember to check references
jrnl done 2
jrnl due 1 eom
jrnl due
jrnl tasks
jrnl notes
jrnl help
```

---

### UX Considerations

* Aliases: `t` = tasks, `n` = notes, `d` = due, `h` = help.
* Minimal color coding, only where it adds clarity (status + due state).
* Keep commands terse; most operations should be single-line.
* Default view = creation-date outline, for quick “what happened today.”
* Optional `due` view helps with forward-looking planning.
